# NianCLS

Archived since I no longer uses the over complicated LaTeX and switched to plainTeX. This document class has finished its font setting up part using the modified NFSS2 which is probably the most crucial part.

If anyone would like to continue develop it, please let me know.

## Introduction

A document class which provides a unified interface for Japanese and (Traditional & Simplified) Chinese typesetting. It is intended to be an enhanced **basic**/**standard** document class.
