# NianCLS

**Still Under (Active) Development**

## Introduction
A document class which provides a unified interface for Japanese and (Traditional & Simplified) Chinese typesetting.
It is intended to be an enhanced **basic**/**standard** document class which is fully customisable, from those `\skip` dimens to the layout, and to the section types.
Macro-packages like `geometry` or `(luatexja)-fontspec` need not be loaded as this document class offers all (more) features and adapts these to CJ typesetting requirements better.

## Development Log
`Starts from 2023-08-21`
 - 2023-08-21: test font and page layout functions and starts to develop font size functions like `\normalsize`.
